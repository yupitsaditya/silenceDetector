While at Samsung, I researched a similar topic, so I started with Kaldi and CMU Sphinx.
These libraries didn't exactly have what I thought we needed, so after doing some research on Google, I came across pydub.
At first, I thought we could directly count words in a file and use speech recognition APIs to convert the audio to speech, but I thought that would defeat the purpose of the experiment.
So instead started looking for audio handling python libraries.

In pydub, we can split the audio on silence, but first, we have to define silence.
We have to define the minimum length of silence and the amplitude. I tried out many different values and decided to use 20ms as the minimum length and -16 dBFS for amplitude.
After processing, we have chunks of audio.
Calculated number of silences = number of chunks-1
Calculated speed = number of chunks/duration of the audio file.
Then using speech recognition library from python converted audio into the text to get the word frequency.

Also, I made a web app for the same. https://ict-ai-position.herokuapp.com/ 
I made this app to demonstrate my web development and web hosting skills. The toughest part was making all the libraries compatible at the server. 
Note: Web app cannot handle large files, and the audio chunks are not accessible for now.

It took around 10 hours to get everything together.

Thanks
